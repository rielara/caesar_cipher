 "In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or
 Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of 
 substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number 
 of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E 
 would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private
  correspondence." - Wikipedia
